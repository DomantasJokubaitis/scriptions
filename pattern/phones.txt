John had been waiting for this call all day.
The phone rang and he quickly glanced at the screen: it was his friend Mark calling from his new number, (415) 555-2671.
He answered and the conversation began. Meanwhile, Sarah was busy organizing her contacts.
She needed to call the new supplier and checked the email again for their contact information.
There it was: For inquiries, please reach out to us at 212-555-0198. She dialed the number and hoped they would be able to expedite her order.
Across town, her colleague Mike was updating the company directory,
which included various contacts like (917) 555-8493 for the HR department and 303-555-7600 for the Denver office.
